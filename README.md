This weather application is built using C++ and Qt, leveraging the OpenWeatherMap API to fetch real-time weather data. The Qt library is used for both JSON parsing and GUI creation, making the development process seamless and efficient.

✨ Features

✅ Fetches real-time weather data from OpenWeatherMap✅ User-friendly GUI built with Qt✅ JSON parsing using Qt JSON library✅ API requests can be made using either WinINet (<wininet.h>) or Qt's networking modules✅ Compatible with Windows

🌐 API Request Methods

WinINet (<wininet.h>): A built-in Windows API for making HTTP requests.
